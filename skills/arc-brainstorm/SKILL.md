name: arc-brainstorm
description: You MUST use this skill for any design exploration, architecture decision, or trade-off analysis before implementation begins — especially when the user says "brainstorm", "explore the design", "think through", "what approach should we take", or describes a feature with multiple valid strategies. This is the arc-native brainstorming skill that writes designs to docs/plans/ and registers them for review via arc plan. Always prefer this over generic brainstorming when the project uses arc issue tracking.

# Brainstorm — Design Discovery

Explore requirements through Socratic dialogue before any implementation begins.

## Hard Gate

**Do NOT write any implementation code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until the design is approved.** Brainstorming produces a design document — not code.

## Workflow

Create a task for each step below using `an explicit checklist`. Mark each as `in_progress` when starting and `completed` when done. This creates a visible progress list in the CLI that carries forward into the plan skill.

### 1. Explore Project Context

- Check existing files, docs, recent commits
- Review existing arc issues (`arc list`)
- Understand what already exists and what constraints are in play

**Scope check before proceeding:** Before asking detailed clarifying questions, assess whether the request describes multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build a platform with chat, storage, billing, and analytics"). If so, help the user decompose into sub-projects first — each sub-project gets its own brainstorm → plan → implement cycle. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs to be split. A decomposition sketch (what are the independent pieces, how do they relate, what order should they be built) is more valuable than a half-specified monolith.

### 2. Ask Clarifying Questions

- Ask questions **one at a time** — don't dump a list
- **Use the user prompt with numbered options** for multiple-choice decisions (2-4 options)
- Use open-ended text questions only when you need freeform feedback
- Understand: purpose, constraints, success criteria, target users
- Continue until you have enough to propose approaches

**Example user prompt with numbered options usage:**
```
Question: "How should we handle session persistence?"
Options:
  - "In-memory only" (simplest, lost on restart)
  - "SQLite" (persistent, single-node, matches existing storage)
  - "Redis" (distributed, adds infrastructure dependency)
```

### 3. Propose 2-3 Approaches

- Each approach: summary, trade-offs, estimated complexity
- Include a recommendation with reasoning
- **Use the user prompt with numbered options** to present approaches as structured choices
- Apply YAGNI — remove features from all designs that aren't explicitly required

**Example user prompt with numbered options usage:**
```
Question: "Which approach should we go with?"
Options:
  - "Approach A: ..." (recommended — trade-offs...)
  - "Approach B: ..." (trade-offs...)
  - "Approach C: ..." (trade-offs...)
```

**Capability-aware hint:** When comparing approaches, surface which imply heavier subagent model tiers during implementation. Approaches with more cross-cutting concerns, more files touched, or tighter coupling between components will likely need `opus`-tier dispatches and more review cycles. Approaches that decompose cleanly into single-file, mechanical tasks will run on `haiku`/`sonnet` and iterate faster. This is a soft consideration, not a deciding factor — but the user should see it.

### 4. Present Design Section by Section

- Break the design into logical sections (data model, API, UI, etc.)
- Present each section and get user approval before moving to the next
- Iterate on sections as needed based on feedback

**Design for isolation and clarity:** Break the system into smaller units that each have one clear purpose, communicate through well-defined interfaces, and can be understood and tested independently. For each unit, you should be able to answer three questions: what does it do, how do you use it, and what does it depend on. Smaller, well-bounded units are also easier for subagents to work with — they reason better about code they can hold in context at once, and their edits are more reliable when files are focused. If a file in the design is projected to grow large, that's often a signal that it's doing too much — consider splitting the responsibility at design time.

**In existing codebases:** Follow existing patterns. Where existing code has problems that affect the work (e.g., a file that's grown too large, unclear boundaries, tangled responsibilities), include targeted improvements as part of the design — the way a good developer improves code they're working in. Don't propose unrelated refactoring. Stay focused on what serves the current goal.

### 5. Identify Shared Contracts (Parallel Readiness)

If the design will produce multiple implementation tasks that could run in parallel, explicitly identify the **shared contracts** — types, interfaces, config keys, constants, and function signatures that multiple tasks will reference.

Contracts fall into two tiers:

- **Shared contracts** (referenced by 2+ tasks): produce **exact, copy-pasteable code blocks** including the type definition AND a contract test assertion. The T0 foundation task will write these verbatim.
- **Task-internal types** (used within a single task): use typed pseudocode (e.g., `FeedbackRequest { memory_id: i64, rating: i8 }`) — the subagent adapts to language idioms during implementation.

Present shared contracts to the user as a "foundation layer" with exact code:

```go
// internal/types/config.go

// SessionConfig holds session-related settings.
type SessionConfig struct {
	Timeout  time.Duration `json:"timeout"`
	MaxIdle  int           `json:"max_idle"`
	Secure   bool          `json:"secure"`
}
```

```go
// internal/storage/storage.go

// GetSession retrieves a session by ID.
// Returns nil and no error if the session does not exist.
GetSession(ctx context.Context, id string) (*Session, error)
```

Contract test assertions verify that the shared types satisfy compile-time expectations. Place these **inline in each relevant test file** with a clear separator:

```go
// internal/types/config_test.go

// --- Contract assertions ---

// Verify SessionConfig fields exist with expected types.
var _ time.Duration = SessionConfig{}.Timeout
var _ int = SessionConfig{}.MaxIdle
var _ bool = SessionConfig{}.Secure
```

```go
// internal/storage/sqlite/sqlite_test.go

// --- Contract assertions ---

// Verify SQLiteStore satisfies the Storage interface.
var _ storage.Storage = (*SQLiteStore)(nil)
```

These exact definitions and contract tests become the **T0 foundation task** during planning — implemented sequentially before any parallel work begins. The T0 task writes the shared type files and embeds contract test assertions inline in each relevant test file, so that parallel agents can import these types immediately and any drift is caught at compile time.

**Skip this step** if the design maps to a single task or purely sequential work.

### 6. Save Design and Register for Review

Write the design document to `docs/plans/` and register it as an ephemeral plan for review:

```bash
# Write the design markdown file
# Use YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md naming convention
cat > docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md <<'EOF'
<design content>
EOF

# Register the plan for review (returns a plan ID + planner URL)
arc plan create docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md
```

The `arc plan create` command returns a plan ID. Use the plan ID to construct the planner URL in the next step.

### 7. Review Loop

After `arc plan create` returns the plan ID, **ALWAYS output the planner URL** so the user can click it directly in their terminal. The `arc plan create` command prints this URL, but also output it yourself to be sure:

```
Plan ready for review:

  http://localhost:7432/planner/<plan-id>

```

Replace `localhost:7432` with the actual server URL if different (check `ARC_SERVER` env var or the arc config).

Then use the **user prompt with numbered options** — include the planner URL directly in the options so the user sees it without scrolling:
```
Question: "Plan ready for review at http://localhost:7432/planner/<plan-id> — how would you like to proceed?"
Options:
  - "Approve" (proceed to /arc-plan for implementation breakdown)
  - "I've submitted feedback in the planner (http://localhost:7432/planner/<plan-id>)" (read comments, revise, re-present)
  - "Save for later" (leave as draft — resume in a new session)
```

**If user approves:**
```bash
arc plan approve <plan-id>
```
Then proceed to step 8.

**If user says "feedback submitted":**
```bash
# Read review comments
arc plan comments <plan-id>
# Also re-read the file content in case the user edited it in the planner
arc plan show <plan-id>
```
Revise the design file based on the feedback, then re-present the planner URL and options. Repeat until approved.

**If user says "save for later":**
Tell the user they can resume by running `/arc-brainstorm` in a new session and referencing the plan file and plan ID.

### 8. Routing Analysis & Transition

After the plan is approved, **you MUST produce a routing analysis before presenting options**. This analysis helps the user make an informed decision about what to do next.

#### Routing Analysis

Evaluate the approved design against these criteria and present a summary:

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Work items** | Count of distinct implementation tasks identified in the design |
| **Parallel readiness** | Were shared contracts identified in step 5? (yes = plan needed for T0 sequencing) |
| **Files touched** | Approximate number of files created or modified |
| **Layers crossed** | Which architecture layers are involved (storage, API, CLI, frontend, tests) |
| **Risk areas** | Any migrations, API changes, or breaking changes? |
| **Scale** | Small / Medium / Large (from Scale Detection table) |

Then produce a **recommendation** with reasoning:

```
📊 Routing Analysis
───────────────────
Work items:       N tasks identified
Parallel ready:   Yes/No (shared contracts in step 5)
Files touched:    ~N files across N directories
Layers crossed:   [storage, API, CLI, ...]
Risk areas:       [migrations, breaking changes, none, ...]
Scale:            Small / Medium / Large

➤ Recommendation: /arc-plan | /arc-build
  Reason: <1-2 sentence justification based on the factors above>
```

**Routing rules** (use these to drive the recommendation):
- **→ arc:plan** when ANY of: 2+ work items, shared contracts exist, multiple layers crossed, migrations or breaking changes present, medium/large scale
- **→ arc:build** when ALL of: single work item, no shared contracts, single layer, no risk areas, small scale
- When borderline, recommend `arc:plan` — the overhead of planning is low, but the cost of a disorganized multi-task implementation is high

After the analysis, use the **user prompt with numbered options** — mark the recommended option:
```
Question: "Design approved! What's next?"
Options:
  - "Break into tasks with /arc-plan" (recommended — <brief reason from analysis>)
  - "Implement directly with /arc-build" (for small, single-task work)
  - "Done for now" (design is saved — continue in a new session)
```

If `/arc-build` is recommended instead, swap which option gets the "(recommended)" tag.

- **Break into tasks**: invoke the `plan` skill, passing the plan ID
- **Implement directly**: invoke the `implement` skill
- **Done for now**: tell the user the plan is approved and they can run `/arc-plan` in a new session

## Scale Detection

| Indicator | Scale | Structure |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Multiple phases, weeks of work, cross-cutting concerns | Large | Meta epic → phase epics → tasks |
| Single feature, days of work, contained scope | Medium | Epic → tasks |
| One task, hours of work, obvious approach | Small | Single issue |

## Rules

- The ONLY next skill after brainstorm is `plan` (or `implement` for small work)
- Never invoke implementation skills from brainstorm
- Design documents go in `docs/plans/` and are registered via `arc plan create <file-path>`
- Arc issues track persistent work; an explicit checklist in the conversation tracks workflow progress in the CLI
- YAGNI: if the user didn't ask for it, don't design it
- Format all arc content (descriptions, plans, comments) per `skills/arc/_formatting.md`
